# PokemonDiamond README

## Introduction
This is an emulator for Pokemon Diamond, focusing primarily on battle mechanics. Players can choose from a selection of around 40 Pokemon, each with unique types and moves, to battle against computer-controlled opponents. The user selects the Pokemon by type and features a battle system where moves' effectiveness varies based on the Pokemon type.

## Features
- **Pokemon Selection:** Choose your Pokemon from a wide range of types including Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Ghost, and more.
- **Battle System:** Engage in battles against a computer. Each Pokemon has a unique set of moves that vary in effectiveness based on the opponent's type.
- **Type Effectiveness:** Moves can be super effective, less effective, or have no effect at all depending on the matchup between the attacker's move type and the defender's Pokemon type.
- **Dynamic Battle Interface:** Battles are dynamic, with real-time updates to HP and status changes.
- **Future Updates:** More features and Pokemon to be added in the future updates.

## Extra Notes
This was the first React project that I've ever done. The only prior knowledge I had was a very introductory class to HTML. This is one of the projects that I have spend the most time, mostly in learning how to code in HTML/CSS as well as Javascript. I will continue working on the game so that the code is much easier to read, instead of all of it being on one .jss file.
